# Random Color Generator with Create React App

A simple random color generator web application using React. This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

- A button with the exact text `Generate` will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked
- Once a color is generated, the background color of a div which contains the text `Generated Color: <background color hex code>` is updated.
- User can input a hue
- User can input a lightness
- Transition smoothly between the colors as they change
- Use a CSS-in-JS library for all styling.
- User can input a size for the color box and generate a box of that size
